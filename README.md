# Pokemon image classification model
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built to classify Pokémon images into their respective categories. The goal was to experiment with a custom CNN and later explore pre-trained models like ResNet to achieve higher accuracy and better performance.

## Features

- Custom CNN model for Pokémon image classification  
- Pre-trained model integration (ResNet) for improved accuracy  
- Training and validation pipeline with image preprocessing  
- Confusion matrix visualization to evaluate performance  

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- PyTorch (if using ResNet)  
- OpenCV / PIL for image preprocessing  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data handling and visualization
  
### note:
This does not include predict.py i will make it awilable soon...
